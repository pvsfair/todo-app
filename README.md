# TODO App

## How to Run

Both apps, back and front, can be ran with the `npm start` command

## Backend

### Data Details

It was implemented with a in memory data source, but because the repository pattern was used, to change it from in memory to a real database is just a matter of db communication, using the same interface/function names that were used on the `*_local.js` repositories.
